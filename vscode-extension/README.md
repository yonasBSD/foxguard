# foxguard for VS Code

Security scanner as fast as a linter. Scans your code on every save and shows findings as underlines.

## Features

- Scans on file save and open — instant feedback
- Status bar shows finding count
- Supports JS/TS, Python, Go, Ruby, Java, PHP, Rust, C#, Swift
- Critical/High → red underline, Medium → yellow, Low → blue
- Rule IDs link to documentation
- Workspace scan via command palette or `Cmd+Shift+G`

## Requirements

foxguard must be installed:

```sh
brew install peaktwilight/tap/foxguard
# or
npm install -g foxguard

```

The extension auto-detects foxguard from PATH, or falls back to npx.
