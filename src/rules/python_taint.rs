//! Intraprocedural, flow-insensitive taint analysis for Python.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! The engine walks a single function body in source order and reports
//! every sink call whose arguments are reachable from a configured source.
//! It is deliberately small:
//!
//! - **Per function.** No cross-function analysis. Each function is analyzed
//!   independently; taint does not cross call boundaries.
//! - **Per file.** No cross-file analysis. Callers of helper functions in
//!   other modules are on their own.
//! - **Flow-insensitive.** Statements are processed in source order. When a
//!   variable is reassigned to a non-tainted expression the old taint is
//!   dropped, but control flow is not modeled — taint observed in one branch
//!   of an `if` is treated as taint in the fall-through. Over-approximation
//!   is the whole point.
//! - **No container sensitivity.** `d["key"]` is tainted if `d` is tainted.
//!   Individual keys are not tracked.
//! - **No attribute propagation beyond one level.** `x.y` is tainted if `x`
//!   is tainted, but taint does not persist on `x.y` as a distinct name.
//! - **Sanitizers collapse to "clean".** When a call whose callee matches a
//!   [`TaintSpec::sanitizers`] entry is applied to a tainted value, the
//!   result is treated as clean — the engine does not track a separate
//!   "sanitized" state the way Semgrep's `mode: taint` does.
//!
//! Everything the engine knows about *which* patterns are sources, sinks, or
//! sanitizers is expressed declaratively via [`TaintSpec`] — nothing is
//! hardcoded about Flask, pickle, or any other library. The POC ships one
//! built-in rule as the first consumer; future rules (including
//! Semgrep-compatible `mode: taint` YAML) will plug into the same API.
